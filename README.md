# Network-Analysis-and-Link-Prediction

I tried to analyse the Facebook Network of TV pages. I used a bunch of graph algorithms to find patters in the network. After that I used logistic regression and LGBM algorithm to do link prediction. Social network analysis report.Pdf has all the results and explanation inside the report folder.

Dataset can be found both here : https://networkrepository.com/fb-pages-tvshow.php  and inside the dataset folder.
the graphml file for gephi visualization is inside the dataset folder as well.
